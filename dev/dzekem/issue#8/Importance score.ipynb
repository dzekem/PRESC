    "Before training a model on this dataset, a good understanding of each explanatory variable (features) is vital.\n",
    "### Definition of each feature\n",
    "\n",
    " - **limit_bal**: limit balance also known as credit limit is the **credit limit** after applying for a credit card determined by the credit card issuer.\n",
    " - **sex:** Sex of the credit card owner which is either 1 for **Male** or 2 for **Female**\n",
    " - **education:** Highest level of education for the credit card owner. where 1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 4 = others\n",
    " - **marriage:** Marital status of credit card owner where 1 = married; 2 = single; 3 = others\n",
    " - **age:** Ages of card owners.\n",
    " - **pay_0 to pay_6:** History of past monthly pay records starting from April(pay_0) to September(pay_6) for each card owner.\n",
    "    statuses are 0: pay duly, 1: payment delay for one month, 2: payment delay for two months.\n",
    " - **bill_amtt1 to bill_amnt6** represents amount of bill statement from April(bill_amt1) to September(bill_amt6). \n",
    "    **Bill statement** is a periodic statement that lists all the payments, purchases and other debits and credits during the billing cycle.\n",
    " - **pay_amt1 to pay_amt6** is amount paid in the previous month. From April(pay_amt1) to September(pay_amt6)\n",
    " - **defaulted:** To defauult means failure to pay a debt on the agreed upon date. IN this case, creditors mostly raise interest rates or decrese the credit limit.\n",
    "        \n",
    "Since defaulted is the target variable in this case, suitable models will be used to train and test the other explanatory variables and see which model predicts with highest accuracy on the dataset.\n"

    " - The model accuracy with the data point at index number 99(part of the train set) still maintained gives an accuracy score of 0.813 on the test set.\n",
    " - After dropping this record at index number 99, the accuracy score on the test data instead increases.\n",
    " - This therefore gives a difference of 0.0015 in accuracy score which shows that this record has a 0.15% infleunce on making the model have better performance on this data."
